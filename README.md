# Pathfinder
> A program that finds the shortest possible path between two points.

Pathfinder uses [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to determine the shortest possible path between point A and point B.
The points are randomly generated.
The map is drawn using an image. Non-transparent pixels are the paths.

I made this project before because I was a delivery guy. I thought it would be cool if I can determine the shortest path when going to places. (Completely ignoring the existence of Google Maps XD)
